# Bar and Column Charts
## When to use a (vertical) bar or column chart

 * Mostly for one variable
 * To compares numerical values for different observations
 * To show relative amounts
 * To break one numerical variable out into different subgroups with grouped or stacked bars or columns

## Style tips

 * Avoid 3D bars or columns
 * The y-axis should start at zero (there are a few instances when it is okay for the y-axis not to start at zero).
 * The width of the bars should be about twice the width of the space between the bars.
 * If all the bars measure the same variable, make them all the same color. Different shades have no relevance to the data.
 * If you are showing fewer than 10 bars, consider eliminating the horizontal gridlines and y-axis line and directly labeling the data points.
 * To differentiate subsets of data, projections, or averages, consider using a different color shade or gray.
 * Legends should be stretched across the top of the chart and the order should match the order in the chart.
 * Sequential series should be shaded from lightest to darkest for easy comparison.


## When to use a (horizontal) bar chart

 * To show the trend in one variable, usually across a number of categories.
 * To show multiple variables with multiple bars(if they are on the same scale).
 * To show the same variable for multiple observations with multiple lines.

## Style tips

 * The y-axis should start at zero (there are a few instances when it is okay for the y-axis not to start at zero).
 * Axis labels should always be horizontal. If you have long labels, consider making a horizontal bar chart instead of a column chart.
 * When using a horizontal bar chart, right-align the category labels and center them vertically with the respect to the bar.
 * Try to avoid vertical grid lines. Instead, directly label each bar.
