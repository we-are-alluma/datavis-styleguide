# Alluma's Data Visualization Style Guide

This is a living document created by the Data TeamðŸ¤“ at [Alluma](https://alluma.org/)

## What do I use this for?
* This style guide is your single point of reference if you are creating visual content at Alluma, for marketing, for product or for internal purposes. 
* If you want to know how to design a graph, a chart or a map, visit the relevant chart sections under **EXAMPLES**.
* If you are looking for guidance on which colors to use for a certain type of map or chart, jump to the **REFERENCES** section.
* If you are looking for more general guidance on how to visualize certain data, the **CASE STUDIES** section will have the information you're looking for (if it doesn't, ping the Data Team!)

This is an open-source project and can be found on [GitHub.com/we-are-alluma/datavis-styleguide](https://github.com/we-are-alluma/datavis-styleguide)
